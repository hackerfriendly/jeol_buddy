On the serial console, commands are acknowledged with the following codes:
	!0: OK
	!3: Bad command
	!4: Command OK, but invalid parameter supplied
	!5: I can't do that, Dave. (eg. SD SEI when the beam is off)

The commands don't seem to be documented anywhere. Here are the ones I've been
able to figure out. They do not seem to be case sensitive.

	get: GA
	set: GA X15 Y-20
	OL aperture get: OLAP
	OL aperture set: OLAP 1..4

	Freeze frame: FREZ ON/OFF
	Integrate, then freeze: INTG
	YZ Modulation: YZM ON/OFF
	D-MAG (digital magnification?): DMG ON/OFF
	IMS input type: IA1 ANA/DIG
	Image Selector: IMS1
		IMS1 SEI
		IMS1 COM
		IMS1 AUX
		IMS1 TOP
		Can be combined, eg. IMS1 SEI COM
		Can't seem to set SEIL, but it can be selected from the EOS menu (be sure to turn on LOWER DETECTOR DEVICE switch on
		console right of CRT #2)

Magnification (Zoom)
	get: MG
	set: MG 20000
	INST mag get: INST
	INST mag set: INST ON/OFF

PMT Link
	PMT ON/OFF
	Leave ON for normal imaging. Turn OFF if contrast is too dim (uncoated biological samples at low accel voltages).

Probe Current
	Probe Coarse get: CC
	Probe Coarse set: CC 1..10
	Probe Fine(!) get: CF
	Probe Fine(!) set: CF ...

Scan Modes
	get current: SM
	imaging: SM PIC
	PIC reduce 2: SM RD2
	PIC reduce 4: SM RD4
	PIC reduce selected: SM RDC
		Set the area in EOS menu 2 -> Position and Width
	Horizontal line: SM LSP
	Bull's eye (for alignment): SM BUP
	Spot mode: SM SPT

Scan Rates
	get: SS
	set FAST: SS TV
	set 2x FAST: SS SR
	set SLOW: SS S1..S3
	set PHOTO: SS P1..P5
	Photo speed get: PS
	Photo speed select: PS P1..5

Stigmatism Adjust
	OL get: ST
	OL set: ST X123 Y-5
	CL get: STC
	CL set: STC X100 Y72
	Note that the stigmatism centering controls are analog and don't seem to allow programmatic adjustment.

Video mode
	VIDO ON/OFF
	Note: if VIDO is OFF, the NTSC frame grabber on the PC will not be able to sync.

Waveform mode
	WFM ON/OFF

Remap PF1-PF10
	To remap, just type eg. PF1 [ANY COMMAND]. The default mappings are:
	PF1 (basic display): PNU2
	PF2 (Electron Optical System menu): EOS
	PF3 (image processing): FIS
	PF4 (Autofocus + Auto contrast/brightness): AUTO
	PF5 (memory contents): MEMO
	PF6 (Split screen frame buffer): DUAL
	PF7 (Quad screen frame buffer): QUAD
	PF8 (Degauss): LC ALL
	PF9 (Autofocus, Autostig, Auto contrast/brightness): AFT,ASTG,ACB
	PF10: MONI I64

Miscellaneous weirdness
	SEI Detector: SD OFF/SEI/REF
	Should always be SEI. Not sure why you'd turn it off, and we have no reference detector.
	Greybar test: TEST
	Brightness histogram: HIST
	CRT #2 annotation mode: PNU2 TEXT
	(no idea how to actually enter annotations)
	To get it back to normal: hit BREAK or PNU2 STATS
	Greyscale Look Up Table editor: LUT
	Read an arbitrary memory location: RD 00000
	Write an arbitrary memory location (DANGEROUS!): WR 7F879 A1
		You can temporarily set the acceleration voltage higher than 30kV by writing values to that memory location. This is used for DC
		conditioning only. DO NOT USE IT FOR IMAGING AS IT CAN DAMAGE THE SEM! Possible values are:
			A1: 32kV
			A6: 33kV
			AB: 34kV
			B0: 35kV
			B6: 36kV
			C0: 38kV
			C9: 40kV
